This Streamlit-based application is designed for customer churn prediction, leveraging a machine learning model trained to classify whether a customer is likely to leave a bank or not. Here's an overview of its functionality:

1. **Title and Introduction**: The app begins with a title "Customer Churn Prediction" and a brief introduction indicating that users should input information to determine if a customer will churn out or not.

2. **Input Fields**: Users are presented with several input fields where they can enter relevant information about a customer. These include:
   - Credit Score
   - Age
   - Tenure (length of time the customer has been with the bank)
   - Account Balance
   - Number of Products
   - Whether the customer has a Credit Card
   - Whether the customer is an Active Member
   - Estimated Salary
   - Location (Geography)
   - Gender

3. **Prediction Button**: After entering the required information, users can click the "Predict" button to trigger the churn prediction process.

4. **Prediction Output**: Upon clicking the prediction button, the application utilizes a pre-trained machine learning model to predict whether the customer will churn out or not based on the input data. It then displays the prediction result, indicating either "The Customer will leave the bank" or "The Customer will not leave the bank".

5. **Model Loading**: The application loads the pre-trained machine learning model from a pickle file (`Customer_Churn_Prediction.pkl`) using Python's `pickle` module.

6. **Prediction Function**: A Python function `predict_churn` preprocesses the input data and uses the loaded model to make predictions.

Overall, this application serves as a convenient tool for users to input customer information and receive churn predictions, which can be valuable for businesses in identifying at-risk customers and implementing retention strategies.
